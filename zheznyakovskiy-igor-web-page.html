<h1> THE 3 WORST SOVIET UNION'S PASSENGER JET AIRCRAFTS </h1>
<p> On this web page I will tell you about the 3 Soviet Union's aircrafts that killed a lot of people. If you will click on the imges it wiil direct you to the web pages with more information.</p>

<h2> TU-104 </h2>
<p> TU-104, this aircraft even got the nickname "The coffin with the wings" because almost all who were flying on first modification of it were doomed to die. 
This aircraft grew up from the bomber TU-16, but the Tu-104 was much bigger and stabilizators' angle was decreased, so the angle of stabilizator was the half of problem. 
The centering, this is process when the aircraft's center of gravity moving back because of overspeeding, nobody knew about it at this time.
The aircraft was entering to the process that was called podhvat or centering, it was called like that because when it was beginning the aircraft suddenly go up and then diving to the ground.
Diving, the pilots can solve this problem by pulling the helm, but the satbilizator's angle was decreased so the pilots couldn't do anything.
After the pilot Kuznetsov crashed Tupolev figured out the problem. Kuznetsov was commenting the situation. The situation started when Air Traffic Controller said that land in Moskow is forbidden. </p>
 <blockquote>
<ul class="dashed"> 
<li>I'm bort 8695 cleared to land.</li>
<li>Bort 8695 the landing is forbidden, go to Sverdlovsk.</li>
<li>I'm bort 8695 I'm guarantee the landing.</li>
<li>Bort 8695 Go to Sverdlovsk.</li>
<li>I'm bort 8695 going to Sverdlovsk.</li>
<li>I'm bort 8695 the aircraft droped up, I can't controll it!</li>
<li>I'm bort 8695 the stabilizator' angle can"t go more!</li>
<li>I'm bort 8695 Mayday! Mayday!</li>
<li>I'm bort 8695 The end, tell my family...</li>
</blockquote>

<h3> TU-134 </h3>
<p> After the TU-104 was made TU-124, but the problem of this aircraft was a loud noise of the engines in the cabin. but then Tupolev saw the french aircraft "CARAVELLA".
The cabin of this aircraft was quiet because the engines was in the tail of the aircraft. 
And then Tupolev Got the TU-124 and moved engines and wings to the tail of the aircraft.
This aircraft was made in 60's but it's still flying right now.
The problem of the aircraft is substandarded assembly, rotten Soviet Union's engines.</p>
<hr>
<h4> TU-154 </h4>
<p> This aircraft was built in the 1968. This aircraft had three engines in the tail. This aircraft had an Soviet Union's engines what was making it dangerous and also it had Soviet Union's electricity.
This aircraft was made to replace Tu-104 and An-10. Until 2013 was using by Aeroflot.</p>
